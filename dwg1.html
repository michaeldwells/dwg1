<p>Use letters from the grid to form words of at 
least two letters. Each letter can only be used 
once, except for the center square which will be 
available for every word.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Words score points based on their lengths.</p>

<table>
<tr>
<th><span class="hideonsmall">Word </span>Length</th>
<td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td>

</table>

<p>The score for each round will be your longest 
word multiplied by your other words added 
together, with a bonus for the minimum word length.</p>

<hr/>

<p>If you clear the board (not including the 
center square) it will reset and the minimum word 
length (indicated by undescores) will increase. 
Scores from each round will be added together.</p>

<p>You can view your score summary any time by 
clicking on your score. This screen will appear 
automatically if the game thinks you're stuck. 
Good luck!</p>

<h1>+ TIPS +</h1>

<p>
The best way to learn the game is to play, but if you're
keen to maximize your score, here are some things to
consider.
</p>
<p>
Firstly, you want to keep going as long as possible. 
Keep an eye on the minimum word length, and plan ahead. 
Try to use up the difficult letters early on in each 
round so that you'll have an easier time clearing the 
grid.
</p>
<p>
Secondly, long words are cruicial to a good score. A 
twelve letter word scores twice as much as a nine letter 
word, for example. Every round needs a good scoring word, 
so have a few in mind.
</p>
<p>
Thirdly, use the center tile as much as possible. It adds 
three free letters to every word, and can make a huge 
difference to your score.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
There is no randomness or hidden information in this game, 
so you could plan your whole run before you start. I 
strongly recommend you don't. The number of possibilities in 
each game is so large that you could waste hours searching 
for the perfect solution. The fun of the game is in the 
strange and surprising words you're able to conjour up when 
pushed.
